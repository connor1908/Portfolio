        I'm a passionate front-end developer with a strong focus on building
        clean, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. I specialize in
        modern JavaScript frameworks, particularly <span>React</span>, and have
        experience crafting sleek UIs with <span>Tailwind CSS</span> and robust
        application state management using <span>Redux</span> and{" "}
        <span>React Query</span>. I also work with <span>Supabase</span> to
        build full-stack features, seamlessly integrating backend functionality
        with front-end experiences.
        <br />I genuinely enjoy working in front-end development. I'm committed
        to continuously improving my skills and delivering high-quality projects
        in a professional and thoughtful manner. My goal is always to create
        products that are both visually engaging and technically sound.
